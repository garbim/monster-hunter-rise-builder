# Contributions to this project

I am not accepting code contributions at this time, but I am happily accepting feedback. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/simshadows/monster-hunter-rise-builder/issues)!

Or, feel free to fork and improve, or use this as a template for a builder program for other games! My only request is to maintain the AGPL licensing and attributions.
