# Monster Hunter Rise Builder

A web-based build calculator for Monster Hunter Rise.

I'm currently hosting it here: <http://mhr-builder.simshadows.com/>

This project was inspired by [Honey's Monster Hunter World build calculator](https://honeyhunterworld.com/mhwbi/).

**This project is an early work-in-progress. Also, I'm still learning React!**

## How do I use this?


## How do I host this myself?

Simply host the `src` directory on a web server. The codebase is totally toolchainless and has no backend application code.

For example, you can use the Python simple server:

```
cd src
python3 -m http.server
```
