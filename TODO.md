# Important TODOs

- I haven't actually run the elemental/status formula through anybody yet. I'll need to get that off someone who's done the research.

- For now, I'm assuming Fortify works similar to Attack Boost % increase, i.e.: `EFR = (FLOOR(base raw including ramp * fortify% * ...) + ...) * ...`. I also haven't factored in Fortify's defense bonus for now.
