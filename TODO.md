# Important TODOs

- I haven't actually run the elemental/status formula through anybody yet. I'll need to get that off someone who's done the research.

- If I implement calculations involving MV's, I'll need to remember that Silkbind attacks can be treated differently to other attacks, such as with Critical Draw and Punishing Draw.

- Heroics has `defense-increasing effects are negated`. What does this mean?
